		<h5><b>Walmart trips</b></h5>
		<ul>MHacks 6 • Ann Arbor, Michigan
			<ul>
				<li>Some experimentation with the Walmart API that I did during MHacks 6. The idea was to show the user
					the furthest Walmart store away from them, and then use the Expedia API to book a flight to it.
					While I was not able to complete this project due to technical difficulties, this project advanced
					my knowledge of both how APIs work as well as javascript.</li>
